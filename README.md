Vibe coded this because I couldn't find something similar and I feel like I needed it for scientific purposes.
Probably an optimization nightmare but it works, well enough for me at least.

## ✨ Features

    * **Transparent Background**: Perfect for viewing sprites and cutouts over your chat background.
